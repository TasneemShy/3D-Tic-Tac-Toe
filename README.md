# 3D Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in a 3D board. Players take turns marking cells in a 3x3x3 board with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- 3D board: The game is played on a 3x3x3 board, adding an extra dimension to the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Player names: Players can enter their names at the beginning of the game.
- Existing data: Optionally, players can continue from a previous game session with existing scores.
- Random symbol assignment: The 'X' and 'O' symbols are randomly assigned to players at the start of each game.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of players' scores across multiple games.
- Clear board visualization: The game board is displayed in a clear and visually appealing format.
- Input validation: Player inputs for selecting cells are validated to ensure they are within the valid range and not already taken.

## How to Play

1. Run the `Tic_Tac_Toe_3D.py` script.
2. Enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2 when prompted.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns marking cells on the board.
4. The game ends when a player wins or the board is filled (resulting in a tie).
5. At the end of each game, you can choose to start a new game or exit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The `random` and `re` modules are used for random selection and regular expression matching, respectively.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `Tic_Tac_Toe_3D.py` file.
